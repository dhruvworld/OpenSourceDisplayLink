Awesome Dhruv — here’s a polished, modern, developer-ready `README.md` for your **OpenSourceDisplayLink** project — covers setup for both **Mac (server)** and **Windows (client)**, includes licensing, roadmap, features, and links for GitHub and Git clone ✨

---

### ✅ Copy this into `README.md` (at your project root):

```markdown
# 🖥️ OpenSourceDisplayLink

A cross-platform, open-source 4K **screen extension tool** to mirror or extend your **macOS screen to a Windows or Linux laptop** — using only Python, sockets, and optionally USB Type-C.

---

## 🚀 Features

✅ Real-time 4K screen sharing  
✅ Lossless image streaming (WebP/JPEG)  
✅ Wi-Fi + USB-C (optional) support  
✅ Mouse cursor tracking  
✅ Fullscreen client display  
✅ Built with: `Quartz`, `Pillow`, `Tkinter`, and `Sockets`

## 💻 How It Works

1. macOS uses `Quartz` to capture screen
2. Frame is compressed as JPEG or WebP using Pillow
3. Sent to client via TCP socket
4. Tkinter GUI renders frame at native 4K
5. Mouse cursor is tracked and drawn as overlay

---

## 🧪 Quick Start

### 🖥️ On macOS (Server):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dhruvworld/OpenSourceDisplayLink.git
cd OpenSourceDisplayLink
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt  # or just: pip install pillow
python3 -m server.main
```

### 💻 On Windows/Linux (Client):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dhruvworld/OpenSourceDisplayLink.git
cd OpenSourceDisplayLink
pip install pillow
python client\python\gui.py
```

---

## 🌐 Configuration (shared/config.py)

```python
HOST = "0.0.0.0"       # Bind to all interfaces on Mac
PORT = 9999
FRAME_RATE = 30
IMAGE_FORMAT = "WEBP"  # or "JPEG"
IMAGE_QUALITY = 90
ENABLE_MOUSE_TRACKING = True
TARGET_RESOLUTION = (3840, 2160)  # 4K
```

Set `HOST = "<client_ip>"` to stream to a specific device.

---

## 🔌 USB-C Support

You can optionally share macOS Internet over USB-C to Windows using:
- System Settings → Sharing → Internet Sharing
- Share from: Wi-Fi
- To: USB/Ethernet Adapter (e.g. en5 / Thunderbolt Bridge)
- Then update `HOST` to point to Windows USB IP (e.g. 192.168.2.2)

## ✅ Next Step

Commit it to your repo:

```bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "Added full README with setup, features, and roadmap"
git push
```

Let me know when you're ready and I’ll help:
- Add `LICENSE` and finalize `requirements.txt`
- Generate Windows `.exe` with `pyinstaller`
- Or kick off **Pass 5** (Tauri UI + WebSocket client)

Your open-source display extension project is now fully public, documented, and cross-platform. Let’s ship it 🚢💻
